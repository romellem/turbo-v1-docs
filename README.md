# Turbo v1 Documentation

The docs for [Turbo v1 are not officially hosted](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/discussions/9069). They are only available via the git history in their repository.

This repo takes those v1 files, builds them to static files, and deploys them to github pages where they can (hopefully) be hosted long into the future.

The URL for the documentation is at:

- [**romellem.github.io/turbo-v1-docs/**](https://romellem.github.io/turbo-v1-docs/)
